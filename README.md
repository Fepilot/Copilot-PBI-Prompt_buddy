# Prompt Buddy for Standalone Copilot in Power BI (Internal - Under Review)

## 📘 Overview

The Standalone Copilot in Power BI is a full-screen, conversational AI assistant that allows users to explore any report or dataset they have access to—without needing deep technical expertise. Unlike the in-report Copilot pane, this experience enables broader, cross-report analysis and natural language querying.

It’s especially powerful when used with the **Copilot Super User Report**, which tracks adoption, engagement, and usage trends across departments and roles. Business users, analysts, and decision-makers can ask questions like:

- “Summarize Copilot usage trends across departments. Highlight which teams are accelerating adoption and which are lagging and what organizational factors might be influencing these patterns.”

- “Analyze usage consistency. Are users engaging with Copilot evenly across the week or in bursts? What does this tell us about workflow integration?”

- “Are there users who started strong but dropped off in usage? What pattern do you see, and how might we re-engage them?”

No need for complex dashboards—just ask and get instant insights. And the power of this tool is that combines the power of PBI Analyzer + a Copilot Reasoning model (GPT-5) which turns it useful not only to get the data but to understand it in a simple way.
