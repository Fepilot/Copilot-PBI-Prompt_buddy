# Prompt Buddy for Standalone Copilot in Power BI (Internal - Under Review)

## 📘 Overview

The Standalone Copilot in Power BI is a full-screen, conversational AI assistant that allows users to explore any report or dataset they have access to—without needing deep technical expertise. Unlike the in-report Copilot pane, this experience enables broader, cross-report analysis and natural language querying.

It’s especially powerful when used with the **Copilot Super User Report**, which tracks adoption, engagement, and usage trends across departments and roles. Business users, analysts, and decision-makers can ask questions like:

- “Which departments have the most super users?”
- “What trends are emerging in Copilot adoption?”
- “Estimate the ROI of Copilot usage last quarter.”

No need for complex dashboards—just ask and get instant insights. And the power of this tool is that combines the power of PBI Analyzer + a Copilot Reasoning model (GPT-5) which turns it useful not only to get the data but to understand it in a simple way.
